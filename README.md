# BeeSchema
## Binary Schema Library for C&#35;

BeeSchema allows you to define the structure of a binary file using a simple schema (*.bee) file, then read the file in a much more human way.  No more BinaryReader or manually reading data from Streams.

*NOTE: BeeSchema was designed as a replacement for the limited structure definition support in [Ostara](https://github.com/Epidal/Ostara).  As such, some features that you require may not be supported.*
